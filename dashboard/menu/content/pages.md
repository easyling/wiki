# Pages & Resources & External links

These screens are duplicated between the Discovery and Content menus for ease of access. See the pertaining documentation of them in the Discovery part of this section.

There is one major difference between the two lists: the exact behavior of the Add Pages button depends on where it is clicked, since it will start the appropriate crawl. If the dialog is opened on the Discovery-pages screen, a Discovery will result; summoning it from Content-pages will start a Content Extraction crawl, generating potentially greater costs!
