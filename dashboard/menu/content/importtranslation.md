# Import translation

When your XLIFF files have made a round in your favourite CAT tool, it is time to reimport them, which is a straightforward process - click on "Import translation" and the Import dialog will pop up, where you can click on "Choose file" to browse for your translated XLIFF files. Click on "Import translation" and wait for the import process to finish.

You may optionally set the workflow status of imported segments to Translated-CONFIRMED, and you can use the second tab in the dialog window to reimport translations from your Dropbox account.

**NOTE!** Importing is not instantaneous, it may take some time to finish depending on the size of your XLIFF!
