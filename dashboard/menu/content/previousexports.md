# Previous exports

Although the notification e-mail does contain the link to your
exported file, there is no reason to track it from your mailbox. This
dialog will list and organize all previous exports for your viewing
with the appropriate timestamp, target language and word count
displayed right next to an Export list entry.

Currently running processes are also displayed, with a spinner
indicating that the Export is still underway.
