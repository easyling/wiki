# Client-Side Translation

The Proxy also provides an additional translation engine in
JavaScript. A project can be exported into a ready-made JavaScript
file that couples with the translation stub provided to enable
translation within the client's browser.

This mode of operation is not without drawbacks, however! Currently,
binary resources such as images will not be replaced, nor will
additional JavaScript/CSS modifiers be injected, as the site now
bypasses the Proxy entirely. Additionally, Automatic Change Detection
will be restricted to the recurring crawls set up on the project, for
the same reason.

The Client-Side Translation offering was premiered on 1 June 2016, and
is currently in open beta phase. If you would like to participate as
an Alpha Customer, please contact our support team from within the
Proxy!
