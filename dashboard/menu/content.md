The main difference between Discoveries and Scans is that Discoveries
do not extract or store content. They are used for statistical
purposes, such as providing a word count or mapping a siteâ€™s URL
structure.

A Content Scan, however, writes into the database. It extracts and
stores the source content to be translated. New source words added to
the database are billed, therefore care must be taken when starting
Scans. If you are not really sure about a site, stick to Discovery
until you gain better understanding of its structure! Unlimited Scans
especially require attention: they will relentlessly add all content
to the database according to the specification you set for them.

Settings you used to experiment with Discoveries can also be used to
initiate Scans - for a detailed explanation of the different settings,
please take a look at the Discovery chapter of this section.

There is button on the main screen that you will not find in the
Discovery menu, that is "Update word count", which you can use to
refresh the statistics window during or after an extended Scan.
