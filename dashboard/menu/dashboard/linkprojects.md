# Link projects

This dialog has a single input field for project codes and looks like this:

![Link Projects](/img/link_project_dialog.png)

Use it to link two projects together. For example, __example.com__ and __blog.example.com__ are separate domains, so two separate Projects (and Scans!) are required to create a full translation for the site. When both projects are ready to be published, use this function to link and serve them together on the proxy.
