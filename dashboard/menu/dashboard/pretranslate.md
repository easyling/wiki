# Pre-translate

By using the Pre-translate menu, you can initiate a process which
supplies untranslated segments with a preliminary translation in order
to mitigate bleedthrough on the proxied pages. You can use
pre-translate with a Translation Memory or a Machine Translation API
of your choice. Easyling supports Google Translate, iTranslate4eu,
Bing Translate and GeoFluent. 

In order to use Machine Translation, you need to go into your Account
and set up your MT account Ids/authorization keys in the "Machine
Translation" menu.

# Auto pre-translate

Auto pre-translate is self-explanatory in that it is the
automatization of pre-translate: here you can set up the project to
automatically execute a pre-translate process for any new content that
is found - you can hook it up with your TMs, or Machine Translation
services to add translations.

You can also generate Work packages from the new content at set
intervals, or send XLIFF files to external systems, such as your XTM,
XTRF, or Dropbox account. There are links at the bottom of the dialog
you can use to visit the settins screens of these accounts.
