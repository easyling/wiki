# Translation memory

Easyling's translation memories (TM) are used to store existing translations for segments. You can import translations from *.tmx files or populate the translation memory with translations you have added in the Workbench.

Type in the name of your Translation memory and click on Create. Your TM will appear right above the input field, along with the "Add target language" option. You can also use the dropdown menu to assign TMs you've created previously.

Hovering over a translation memory reveals a menu, which allows you to import/export *.tmx files or populate the TM with existing translations. Use the "Remove" button to delete the TM.

The screen is furnished with a search field you can use to look up segments in a TM.

## **NOTE!**

The TMs you manage on this screen and the Workbench are different from the Translation Memory that is billed: they are used for concordance lookups and automatic translation, and they are completely free to create and use.

On the other hand, the proxy TM associated with a project is a database in the cloud that holds translations of segments. When you reimport your XLIFF files or run auto-pretranslate, you are writing to this project TM, which is billed the first time around.
