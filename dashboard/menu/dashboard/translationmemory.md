# Translation memory

Easyling's translation memories (TM) are used to store existing
translations for segments. You can import translations from *.tmx
files or populate the translation memory with translations you have
added in the Workbench.

Type in the name of your Translation memory and click on Create. Your
TM will appear right above the input field, along with the "Add target
language" option. You can also use the dropdown menu to assign TMs
you've created previously.

Hovering over a translation memory reveals a menu, which allows you to
import/export *.tmx files or populate the TM with existing
translations. Use the "Remove" button to delete the TM.

The screen is furnished with a search field you can use to look up
segments in a TM.
