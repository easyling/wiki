# Audit log

The audit log is the minutes-taking feature of Easyling. It records
all activity on the project with a username/e-mail address attached to
each entry.

Some Audit Log entries can get quite long, such as when Page Modifier
or CSS overrides are being edited and saved multiple times. For this
reason, the Audit log displays onlythe first three lines of long
entries by default. Use the grey bar with the downward-pointing arrow
under a log entry to see the full text of that entry.
