## Path settings - Cache & Cookie, Content Type Overrides

You can add project paths here and define Cache and Cookie overrides
for them. Enter a new path, which you can set to be a prefix or an
exact URL, and click on Add Path. A NEw rule dropdown menu will
appear. You can choose either Cache and Cookie Overrides, Content Type
Overrides, or both. After selecting one, the dropdown will disappear,
but you'll still be able to add the other using the plus icon that
appears next to the path.

By clicking on 'Edit rule', you can set the Cache override to public,
private or ignore according to your needs. set the maxAge and override
type (whether to clear or use cookies) and you're set.

Use the Save icon next to the rule name or the blue 'Save all' button
to save your settings.

You can always return here and add new paths and rules using the 'Add
new path' button if there is a need for it.
