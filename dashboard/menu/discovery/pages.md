# Pages

The Page List is accessible from both the Discovery and Content menus. By default (before starting any Discoveries or Scans), only the root path ("/") will be present. Later, all pages/paths added manually or found during Discoveries and Scans will listed here.

Clicking on a pathname will take you to that URL on the original site. If you hover your cursor over it, a menu will appear to the right:

The first two buttons, "Translation in List View" and "Translation in Highlight View" will take you to the workbench. To learn more about the various editing modes, please visit the **Workbench** part of the documentation.

**NOTE!** Most of these buttons are disabled and unclickable as long as no target language is selected in the Language dropdown on the left side of the Page list!

By clicking on the third button, "Preview", you will be introduced to the preview proxy mode, which you can use to review your translation efforts in the full context of the original website over the proxy. By holding Ctrl and clicking on the Preview button, you will be taken to another useful mode, the x-proxy. We'll get into these proxy modes in detail later on in this manual (see **here** for the details).

At the top, you will see a few icons you can click to access detailed function accessible from the page list. They are as follows:

**Copy current URL list to clipboard** will open a new dialog containing project information and all pages in a pre-selected list.  You can copy & paste this list, or click on Export to receive an XLS spreadsheet in an e-mail.

**Search bar** When the page list gets too long to scroll through manually, you can use the Search Bar to look up any path names that match your query. This is a forward-search (note that regular expressions are not supported in the Page list).
