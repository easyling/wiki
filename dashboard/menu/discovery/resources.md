# Resources

Resources are binary content, such as images, PDFs, CSS and textual
sources such JS files, etc. It is important to remember that the
content of these resources is not extracted for translation, so you
have to translate / edit them separately.

When you open this screen, a subset of all Resources collected during
a previous crawl will be listed. Scroll down to load more, or use the
search field for lookup (as some websites are quite Resource-heavy,
the search function is recommended). 

Hover and click over any Resource to display a localization dialog for
it. You can click on the green "plus" icon to mark the Resource as
translatable. After doing so, a few fields will be added to the
dialog: a source and a target language text box you can use to
transcribe the Resrouce, and a target URL field which will contain the
the URL of the localized Resource on the proxy. Use the "Choose File"
button to upload a localized Resource.

Note that you can only localize Resources _one at a time_ and on a
_strictly target language basis_ (make sure you have the appropriate
target language selected on the left side of the screen).

You can click on the flags on the lower left side of the frame to
check the localized and original versions of a Resource (especially
images, which will be displayed within the dialog). Document browsing,
however, is not supported on the Resources screen.
