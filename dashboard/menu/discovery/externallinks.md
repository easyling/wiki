# External links

All external links will be collected (and all external domains will be listed in Discovery), and sometimes, external links need to be localized, such as when documents, data files and downloads are served from an external domain. If you are translating www.example.com, but it's downloads section is filled with links to files on files.example.com, you can use this feature to replace the links to point to a localized Resource of your own choosing.
