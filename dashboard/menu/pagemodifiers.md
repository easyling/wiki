While translation over the proxy makes website localization easy, it is also a fact that UI issues can sometimes surface when a page is proxied.

Suddenly served in a different language from the one the UI designers anticipated, websites can display a variety of UI quirks. As website translation is still, sadly, more often than not an afterthought, these issues have to be dealt with in the translation pipeline.

Word length differences between the source and target languages might cause the menu to crowd. Differences between the lengths of different text blocks can cause otherwise well-designed CSS rules to behave in unexpected ways. Not to mention the plethora of plugins that run on a modern website - there is a big pool of possible glitches right there.

Fortunately, changing the site content over the proxy is relatively easy. The Page Modifiers function is made available for this reason: to empower you to add your own CSS rules and JavaScript snippets to influence the way a given proxied site looks to the user.

Because the datastream must pass through the proxy to have the translation embedded, the proxy can insert JavaScript modifiers, modify style sheets, even embed entire pages that do not exist on the original site.

CSS rules and JavaScript are injected into each page that is served over the proxy.
