# Views

There is more than one way of looking at content on the Workbench, and
the default, the List View is only one of them. In this section, we go
over the various in-context 'Views' you can access from the Workbench
and use to edit your translation while making sure that it is behaving
exactly as it should in the original context.

## List View

While not the most impressive, the List View is certainly one of the
most useful views on the Workbench. You can use it to go over each and
every segment being translated. First off, let's take a look at a
segment and see what information the List view provides about it.

### Anatomy of a Segment
