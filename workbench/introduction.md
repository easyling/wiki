# Introduction 

The Workbench is a CAT tool in the cloud.

If the Dashboard is our take on the project management side of webiste
localization, then the Workbench is the analogous CAT tool you can use
without ever leaving the browser window.

In this chapter, we take a close look at all the various features
available on the Workbench. The explanations pertaining to the various
elements and functionality of the Workbench screen are grouped into
thematically linked subsections. Use the sidebar to navigate to the
subsection of your choice.
