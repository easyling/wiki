# Automated scan

####How do I enable automated scan on my project?

To enable automated content extraction on your site, please go to Content, and choose either of the daily, weekly or monthly options in the drop-down next to the Look for changes option.


####Is it possible to set up automated scanning behind secure login?  
  
No, scanning can't be automated behind secure login. For such processes you need to [extract cookies](secure-login.md) with you browser's dev. tools and pass them on to the proxy. Some cookies get invalidated over time, and we don't store cookies either.
